title: Neo4j Vector Index
---

Neo4j is an open-source graph database with integrated support for vector similarity search.
It supports:

- approximate nearest neighbor search
- Euclidean similarity and cosine similarity
- Hybrid search combining vector and keyword searches

## Setup

To work with Neo4j Vector Index, you need to install the `neo4j-driver` package:

```bash npm
npm install neo4j-driver
```
import IntegrationInstallTooltip from '/snippets/javascript-integrations/integration-install-tooltip.mdx';

<IntegrationInstallTooltip/>

```bash npm
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

### Setup a `Neo4j` self hosted instance with `docker-compose`

`Neo4j` provides a prebuilt Docker image that can be used to quickly setup a self-hosted Neo4j database instance.
Create a file below named `docker-compose.yml`:

import DockerExample from "/snippets/javascript-integrations/examples/indexes/vector_stores/neo4j_vector/docker_example.mdx";

<DockerExample />

And then in the same directory, run `docker compose up` to start the container.

You can find more information on how to setup `Neo4j` on their [website](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/).

## Usage

import Neo4jVector from "/snippets/javascript-integrations/examples/indexes/vector_stores/neo4j_vector/neo4j_vector.mdx";

One complete example of using `Neo4jVectorStore` is the following:

<Neo4jVector />

### Use retrievalQuery parameter to customize responses

import Neo4jVectorRetrieval from "/snippets/javascript-integrations/examples/indexes/vector_stores/neo4j_vector/neo4j_vector_retrieval.mdx";

<Neo4jVectorRetrieval />

### Instantiate Neo4jVectorStore from existing graph

import Neo4jVectorExistinggraph from "/snippets/javascript-integrations/examples/indexes/vector_stores/neo4j_vector/neo4j_vector_existinggraph.mdx";

<Neo4jVectorExistinggraph />

### Metadata filtering

import Neo4jVectorMetadata from "/snippets/javascript-integrations/examples/indexes/vector_stores/neo4j_vector/neo4j_vector_metadata.mdx";

<Neo4jVectorMetadata />

# Disclaimer ⚠️

_Security note_: Make sure that the database connection uses credentials
that are narrowly-scoped to only include necessary permissions.
Failure to do so may result in data corruption or loss, since the calling
code may attempt commands that would result in deletion, mutation
of data if appropriately prompted or reading sensitive data if such
data is present in the database.
The best way to guard against such negative outcomes is to (as appropriate)
limit the permissions granted to the credentials used with this tool.
For example, creating read only users for the database is a good way to
ensure that the calling code cannot mutate or delete data.
