<AlphaCallout />

<Note>
    1.0 Alpha releases are available for the following packages:

    - `langchain`
    - `langchain-core`

    - `langchain-aws`
    - `langchain-openai`

    Broader support will be rolled out during the alpha period.
</Note>

## <Icon icon="sparkles" /> New features

LangChain 1.0 introduces new features:

- A new `.content_blocks` property on message objects. This property provides a fully typed view of message content and standardizes modern LLM features across providers, including reasoning, citations, server-side tool calls, and more. There are no breaking changes associated with the new message content. Refer to the [message content](/oss/langchain/messages#content) docs for more info.

- New prebuilt `langgraph` chains and agents in `langchain`. The surface area of the `langchain` package has been reduced to focus on popular and essential abstractions. A new `langchain-legacy` package is available for backward compatibility. Refer to the new [agents docs](/oss/langchain/agents) and to the [release notes](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/releases/tag/langchain%3D%3D1.0.0a1) for more detail.

## <Icon icon="ban" /> Breaking changes

<Accordion title="Dropped Python 3.9 support" icon="python">
    Python 3.9 is [end of life](https://devguide.python.org/versions/) in October 2025. Consequently, all LangChain packages now require Python 3.10 or higher.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Some legacy code moved to `langchain-legacy`">
    The new `langchain` package features a reduced surface area that focuses on standard interfaces for LangChain components (e.g., `init_chat_model` and `init_embeddings`) as well as pre-built chains and agents backed by the `langgraph` runtime.

    Existing functionality outside this focus, such as the indexing API and exports of `langchain-community` features, have been moved to the `langchain-legacy` package.

    To restore the previous behavior, update package installs of `langchain` to `langchain-legacy`, and replace imports:

    Before:
    ```python
    from langchain import ...
    ```

    After:
    ```python
    from langchain_legacy import ...
    ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Updated return type for chat models">
    The return type signature for chat model invocation has been fixed from `BaseMessage` to `AIMessage`. Custom chat models implementing `bind_tools` should update their return signature to avoid type checker errors:

    Before:
    ```python
    Runnable[LanguageModelInput, BaseMessage]:
    ```

    After:
    ```python
    Runnable[LanguageModelInput, AIMessage]:
    ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Default message format for OpenAI Responses API">
    When interacting with the Responses API, `langchain-openai` now defaults to storing response items in message `content`. This behavior was previously opt-in by specifying `output_version="responses/v1"` when instantiating `ChatOpenAI`. This was done to resolve `BadRequestError` that can arise in some multi-turn contexts.

    **To restore previous behavior**, set the `LC_OUTPUT_VERSION` environment variable to `v0`, or specify `output_version="v0"` when instantiating `ChatOpenAI`:

    ```python
    os.environ["LC_OUTPUT_VERSION"] = "v0"

    # or

    from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

    llm = ChatOpenAI(model="...", output_version="v0")
    ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Default `max_tokens` in `langchain-anthropic`">
    The `max_tokens` parameter in `ChatAnthropic` will now default to new values that are higher than the previous default of `1024`. The new default will vary based on the model chosen.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Removal of deprecated objects">

Methods, functions, and other objects that were already deprecated and slated for removal in 1.0 have been deleted.

{/* TODO full list? */}

</Accordion>

## <Icon icon="box-archive" /> Deprecations

<Accordion title="`.text()` is now a property">
    Use of the `.text()` method on message objects should be updated to drop the parentheses:

    ```python
    # Before
    text = response.text()  # Method call

    # After
    text = response.text    # Property access
    ```

    Existing usage patterns (i.e., `.text()`) will continue to function but now emit a warning.
</Accordion>


## <Icon icon="robot" /> Prebuilt agents

The **`langchain`** release focuses on reducing LangChain's surface area and narrowing in on popular and essential abstractions.

### ReAct agent migration

**`create_react_agent` has moved from `langgraph.prebuilts` to `langchain.agents`** with significant enhancements:

**Enhanced structured output**

`create_agent` has improved coercion of outputs to structured data types:

```python
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Weather(BaseModel):
    temperature: float
    condition: str

def weather_tool(city: str) -> str:
    """Get the weather for a city."""
    return f"it's sunny and 70 degrees in {city}"

agent = create_agent(
    "openai:gpt-4o-mini",
    tools=[weather_tool],
    response_format=Weather
)
result = agent.invoke({"messages": [HumanMessage("What's the weather in SF?")]})
print(repr(result["structured_response"]))
#> Weather(temperature=70.0, condition='sunny')
```

**Structural improvements**

- **Main loop integration**: Structured output is now generated in the main loop instead of requiring an additional LLM call
- **Tool/output choice**: Models can choose between calling tools, generating structured output, or both
- **Cost reduction**: Eliminates extra expense from additional LLM calls

**Advanced configuration**

Two strategies for structured output generation:

1. **Artificial tool calling** (default for most models)
    - LangChain generates tools matching your response format schema
    - Model calls these tools, LangChain coerces args to desired format
    - Configure with `ToolStrategy` hint

2. **Provider implementations**
    - Uses native structured output support when available
    - Configure with `ProviderStrategy` hint

<Warning>
    **Prompted output** is no longer supported via the `response_format` argument.
</Warning>

### Error handling

**Structured output errors**

Control error handling via the `handle_errors` arg to `ToolStrategy`:

- **Parsing errors**: Model generates data that doesn't match desired structure
- **Multiple tool calls**: Model generates 2+ tool calls for structured output schemas

**Tool calling errors**

Updated error handling for tool failures:

- **Invocation failure**: Agent returns artificial `ToolMessage` asking model to retry (unchanged)
- **Execution failure**: Agent now raises `ToolException` by default instead of retrying (prevents infinite loops)

Configure behavior via `handle_tool_errors` arg to `ToolNode`.

### Breaking changes

**Pre-bound models**

To better support structured output, `create_agent` no longer supports pre-bound models with tools or configuration:

```python
# No longer supported
model_with_tools = ChatOpenAI().bind_tools([some_tool])
agent = create_agent(model_with_tools, tools=[])

# Use instead
agent = create_agent("openai:gpt-4o-mini", tools=[some_tool])
```

<Note>
    Dynamic model functions can return pre-bound models if structured output is *not* used.
</Note>

**Import changes**

```python
# Before
from langgraph.prebuilts import create_agent, ToolNode, AgentState

# After
from langchain.agents import create_agent, ToolNode, AgentState
```
