title: Self-hosted
---
The Self-Hosted deployment option allows you to run all components entirely within your own cloud environment. You can choose between two deployment models:

1. **[Full Platform](#full-platform)**: Deploy both control plane and data plane with full UI/API management capabilities
2. **[Standalone Server](#standalone-server)**: Deploy standalone instances of a LangGraph Server without the control plane UI

<Info>
**Important**
The Self-Hosted deployment options require an [Enterprise](/langgraph-platform/plans) plan.

## Full Platform

### Overview

The Full Platform deployment model is a fully self-hosted solution where you manage both the [control plane](/langgraph-platform/control-plane) and [data plane](/langgraph-platform/data-plane) in your cloud. This option gives you full control and responsibility of the control plane and data plane infrastructure.

|                   | [Control plane](/langgraph-platform/control-plane) | [Data plane](/langgraph-platform/data-plane) |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| **What is it?** | <ul><li>Control plane UI for creating deployments and revisions</li><li>Control plane APIs for creating deployments and revisions</li></ul> | <ul><li>Data plane "listener" for reconciling deployments with control plane state</li><li>LangGraph Servers</li><li>Postgres, Redis, etc</li></ul> |
| **Where is it hosted?** | Your cloud | Your cloud |
| **Who provisions and manages it?** | You | You |

### Requirements

* You use `langgraph-cli` and/or [LangGraph Studio](/langgraph-platform/langgraph-studio) app to test graph locally.
* You use `langgraph build` command to build image.
* You have a Self-Hosted LangSmith instance deployed.
* You are using [Ingress](/langsmith/self-host-ingress) for your LangSmith instance. All agents will be deployed as Kubernetes services behind this ingress.

### Architecture

### Compute Platforms

* **Kubernetes**: The Full Platform deployment model supports deploying control plane and data plane infrastructure to any Kubernetes cluster.

<Tip>
If you would like to enable this on your LangSmith instance, please follow the [Self-Hosted Full Platform deployment guide](/langgraph-platform/deploy-self-hosted-full-platform).
</Tip>

## Standalone Server

### Overview

The Standalone Server Only deployment model is the least restrictive option for deployment. There is no [control plane](/langgraph-platform/control-plane). A simplified version of the [Data plane](/langgraph-platform/data-plane) infrastructure is managed by you.

|                   | [Control plane](/langgraph-platform/control-plane) | [Data plane](/langgraph-platform/data-plane) |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| **What is it?** | n/a | <ul><li>LangGraph Servers</li><li>Postgres, Redis, etc</li></ul> |
| **Where is it hosted?** | n/a | Your cloud |
| **Who provisions and manages it?** | n/a | You |

<Warning>
LangGraph Platform should not be deployed in serverless environments. Scale to zero may cause task loss and scaling up will not work reliably.
</Warning>

### Compute Platforms

#### Kubernetes

The Standalone Server deployment model supports deploying data plane infrastructure to a Kubernetes cluster.

#### Docker

The Standalone Server deployment model supports deploying data plane infrastructure to any Docker-supported compute platform.

<Tip>
To deploy a [LangGraph Server](/langgraph-platform/langgraph-server), follow the how-to guide for [how to deploy the Standalone Server](/langgraph-platform/deploy-standalone-server).
