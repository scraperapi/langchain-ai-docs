[LangGraph Studio](/langgraph-platform/langgraph-studio) supports connecting to two types of graphs:

- Graphs deployed on [LangGraph Platform](#langgraph-platform).
- Graphs running locally via the [LangGraph Server](#local-development-server).

## LangGraph Platform

LangGraph Studio is accessed from the LangSmith UI, within the **LangGraph Platform Deployments** tab.

For applications that are [deployed](/langgraph-platform/deployment-quickstart) on LangGraph Platform, you can access Studio as part of that deployment. To do so, navigate to the deployment in LangGraph Platform within the LangSmith UI and click the **LangGraph Studio** button.

This will load the Studio UI connected to your live deployment, allowing you to create, read, and update the [threads](/oss/langgraph/persistence#threads), [assistants](/langgraph-platform/assistants), and [memory](/oss/concepts/memory) in that deployment.

## Local development server

To test your application locally using LangGraph Studio, follow the [local application quickstart](/langgraph-platform/local-server) first.

<Info>
**LangSmith Tracing**
For local development, if you don't want data traced to LangSmith, set `LANGSMITH_TRACING=false` in your application's `.env` file. With tracing disabled, no data leaves your local server.
</Info>

Next, install the [LangGraph CLI](/langgraph-platform/langgraph-cli):

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install -U "langgraph-cli[inmem]"
langgraph dev
```

```bash uv
uv add langgraph-cli[inmem]
langgraph dev
```

```bash npm
npx @langchain/langgraph-cli dev
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
**Browser Compatibility**
Safari blocks `localhost` connections to Studio. To work around this, run the above command with `--tunnel` to access Studio via a secure tunnel.
</Warning>

This will start the LangGraph Server locally, running in-memory. The server will run in watch mode, listening for and automatically restarting on code changes. Read this [reference](/langgraph-platform/cli#dev) to learn about all the options for starting the API server.

You will see the following logs:

```
> Ready!
>
> - API: [http://localhost:2024](http://localhost:2024/)
>
> - Docs: http://localhost:2024/docs
>
> - LangGraph Studio Web UI: https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024
```

Once running, you will automatically be directed to LangGraph Studio.

For an already running server, access Studio by either:

1. Directly navigate to the following URL: `https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024`.
2. Within LangSmith, navigate to the **LangGraph Platform Deployments** tab, click the **LangGraph Studio** button, enter `http://127.0.0.1:2024` and click **Connect**.

If running your server at a different host or port, simply update the `baseUrl` to match.

### (Optional) Attach a debugger

For step-by-step debugging with breakpoints and variable inspection:

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
# Install debugpy package
pip install debugpy
# Start server with debugging enabled
langgraph dev --debug-port 5678
```

```bash uv
# Install debugpy package
uv add debugpy
# Start server with debugging enabled
langgraph dev --debug-port 5678
```
</CodeGroup>

Then attach your preferred debugger:

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="VS Code">
    Add this configuration to `launch.json`:

    ```json
    {
        "name": "Attach to LangGraph",
        "type": "debugpy",
        "request": "attach",
        "connect": {
          "host": "0.0.0.0",
          "port": 5678
        }
    }
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="PyCharm">
    1. Go to Run â†’ Edit Configurations
    2. Click + and select "Python Debug Server"
    3. Set IDE host name: `localhost`
    4. Set port: `5678` (or the port number you chose in the previous step)
    5. Click "OK" and start debugging
    </Tab>
</Tabs>
